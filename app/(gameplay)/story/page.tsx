        Nethermoor — a foggy, forgotten town nestled deep in the woods, isolated
        from the outside world. The town has a population of just under 500.
        It&apos;s constantly overcast, and the forest grows unnaturally close to
        the town&apos;s edges. Strange symbols are carved into the old trees,
        and at night, distant screams echo faintly through the mist.

        Over the past 3 months, three children have vanished — all between the
        ages of 9 and 11. Their bodies were later found deep in the woods,
        arranged in ritualistic positions with their mouths sewn shut and a
        strange black mineral inside. Rumors swirl of an old town legend — The
        Hollow One, a faceless being that takes on human form and feeds on
        “truth” and “innocence.”

        You were a detective in the city — hardened by years of working
        homicide, gang cases, and cold files that never thawed. You weren&apos;t
        the best at paperwork or playing nice with superiors, but your
        instincts? Razor sharp. That&apos;s what made them send you to
        Nethermoor — not as a promotion, not as a punishment, but because no one
        else would go. It started with a call from a higher-up in Internal
        Affairs, whispering about a “special case” in a small town where “normal
        rules don&apos;t apply.” The town had filed requests for outside help.
        Three children murdered in three months, strange evidence, zero leads,
        and a growing silence from the local authorities. Something wasn&apos;t
        adding up. You took the case — not because you believed the ghost
        stories, but because there was something in the voice on the line. Fear.
